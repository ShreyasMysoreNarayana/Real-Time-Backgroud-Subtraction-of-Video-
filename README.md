# Real-Time-Backgroud-Subtraction-of-Video-
Create a real-time algorithm to spot moving objects in  videos by subtracting the background. ● Study current methods to identify the best features. ● Make the algorithm handle changes in light and  movement in the background. ● Use OpenCV and advanced DIP techniques to clear up  the image and reduce noise.
